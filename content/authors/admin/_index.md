I am a first-year PhD student in the CS department at MIT, where I am advised by [Ryan Williams](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/). Prior to this, I did studied math and computer science at Rutgers University, where I was lucky enough to spend time learning from [Eric Allender](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/) and [Michael Saks](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~saks/). I also participated in the [DIMACS REU program](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/) in 2017 and 2018.

My current research is centered in the relatively young field of "Computational Complexity Theory," which, roughly speaking, studies the resources (like time and hardware) needed to accomplish certain computational tasks (like finding the fastest route from point A to point B on a map).

So far, my research has mainly focused on studying a specific computational task called the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP). Part of the reason why MCSP is interesting is that it represents a "universal attack on cryptography." In other words, if someone can find a fast algorithm for MCSP, then they would be able to break every type of cryptography imaginable. Since we would like for our cryptography to be secure, one would hope that MCSP is not an easy problem to solve. My current research agenda is working towards showing "hardness" for MCSP.
